#Python uses backslashes to encode special characters. For example:
#tab_string = "\t" # represents the tab character
#len(tab_string) # is 1





#If you want backslashes as backslashes (which you might in Windows
#directory names or in regular expressions), you can create raw strings using
#r"":
#not_tab_string = r"\t" # represents the characters '\' and 't'
#len(not_tab_string) # is 2

#full_name1 = first_name + " " + last_name # string addition
#full_name2 = "{0} {1}".format(first_name, last_name) # string.format

#full_name3 = f"{first_name} {last_name}"
