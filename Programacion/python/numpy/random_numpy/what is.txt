Random number does not mean differtente number every time, instead mean that can not be predicted logically.

Pesudo Ramdom and True Ramdom 


If there is a program to generate random number it can be predicted, thus it is not truly random.

Random numbers generated through a generation algorithm are called psPSEUDO RAMDOM.

Can we make truly random numbers?

Yes. In order to generate a truly random number on our computers we need to get the random data from some outside source.
